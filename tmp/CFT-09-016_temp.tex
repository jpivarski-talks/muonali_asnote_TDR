\section{Global Muon Alignment}
\label{sec:global_muon_alignment}

Local muon alignment procedures arrange sets of chambers in
self-consistent coordinate systems, but cannot relate those
coordinates to the locations of other subsystems of CMS, particularly
the tracker.  In this section, we describe methods to
align muon chambers relative to the tracker, such that all
tracking volumes in CMS share one global system of coordinates.  Since
these global alignment methods are partly independent of the local alignments,
they can be used to cross-check each other.

Two algorithms, HIP (Hits and Impact Points) and Millepede, have been
developed to align muon chambers relative to the tracker.  Each is
described in its own section below, followed by studies in Monte Carlo
simulations, and then results of each with cosmic ray data.
